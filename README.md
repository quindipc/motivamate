## Scope & Features
Key Challenges/Problem Statement
I struggle with keeping myself accountable when working/coding. Having a virtual workspace/work buddy to work alongside with could be helpful in a remote work setting.

Main challenges remote workers face, such as:
Lack of motivation
Poor time management
Isolation and lack of interaction
Difficulty in tracking tasks and progress
